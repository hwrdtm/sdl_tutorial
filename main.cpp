The working directory is where your application thinks it is operating. Typically, your working directory is the directory where your executable is at but some programs like Visual Studio change the working directory to where the vcxproj file is located. So if your application can't find the image, make sure it is in the right place.

If an event from the event queue is an SDL_QUIT event (which is the event when the user Xs out the window), we set the quit flag to true so we can exit the application.

See when you draw to the screen, you are not typically drawing to the image on the screen you see. By default, most rendering systems out there are double buffered. These two buffers are the front and back buffer.
            //
            //  When you make draw calls like SDL_BlitSurface, you render to the back buffer. What you see on the screen is the front buffer. The reason we do this is because most frames require drawing multiple objects to the screen. If we only had a front buffer, we would be able to see the frame as things are being drawn to it which means we would see unfinished frames. So what we do is draw everything to the back buffer first and once we're done we swap the back and front buffer so now the user can see the finished frame.
            //
            //  This also means that you don't call SDL_UpdateWindowSurface after every blit, only after all the blits for the current frame are done.
